                <p>My cohort was given a month of information training before starting floor training. During this time, I was tasked to become familiar with medical terminology including ...

                    Prior to floor training, we were given a comprehensive introduction to Cerner Systems and which mechanisms to use to best make use of time. I passed all administered quizzes with greater than 95% to be cleared to advance with floor training.

                    Durning floor training, I was under the direct supervision of a Lead Scribe in a normal shift setting. I started with learning how to take notes and use abbreviations to not only keep up with providers but also document all information given. We were given 6 training shifts to cover all of the time slots that are available including an early morning, night, and afternoon shift. With the last floor training,I was cleared to work independently and given the feedback:

                <p>Each provider has different preferences as I was expected to scribe based on their preferences. Some doctors prefer to read their own x-rays and others want the scribe to notify them if a radiologist reads them. From this, I was able to advance by ability to multitask and be able to handle many different sources of information at once.

                <p>Also, since our hospital switched over to StatRad over the night, I had to keep track of both the patient’s charts and radiology readings in a different section. In many cases, I just came back from visiting a patient with a provider and had notes I had to input into their chart, but as patients have different acuities, I would check other notes before putting in new ones. This allowed me to understand how to prioritize by workflow in a busy environment and lessen the chance of becoming overwhelmed with my responsibilities.

                Working in the ED gave me a very different view on how providers need to handle their patients. They have to balance the acuity of the patient with the length of stay that they have. Additionally, in many cases, they need to correlate many different views of an incident to treat the patient. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the main things that I learned was to never ask a patient what they want. In many cases when someone is in the ED, they are too overwhelmed and are looking at the provider for guidance. While it may seem nicer to give the patient more options, it might actually put them in decision paralysis. In this case, providers have taught me how to guide a patient without compromising their personal choice. 

            </p>
            <p>
                I hope to further explore the medical field and understand the reasoning for the decisions that providers make. I have learned so much in the little time that i have worked here and am excited for any new opportunities and experience that will follow.
