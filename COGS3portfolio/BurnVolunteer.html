                <p>As a volunteer, I ensured necessary supplies were stocked and in reach for providers, nurses and techs. I ran time-sensitive labs and collected materials from other departments for Burn use. At this center, I interacted more with physical therapists, nurses, and burn technicians and was able to get insight as to how they communicated with doctors and relayed that information to patients in an inpatient setting.

                <p>One of the most memorable stories was a patient in his 70s had accidentally burned his facility. He was sleeping with a lit cigarette when it fell out of his mouth and caught the blanket on fire. He was sent to the center for his burns but after he was healed, no nursing facility would have him in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He seemed to always want some sort of nursing help, whether that be to get him a blanket, sit him up, get him food or water. His burns were all healed but he seemed like the most needy patient.

                </p>
                <p>
                    On one shift when I had time to sit down and talk to him, he was a really sweet guy; always wanting to know more about me or how the nurses have been. When I asked if he minded staying in the hospital for this long, at that point it had been around 180 days, he said 
                </p>
                <table id="quote">
                    <tr>
                        <th>
                            "I didn't get much talking to there. It's much more homely here"
                        </th>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>While I have heard of how it is at facilities, this was one of the first times it hit me about the environment there. Physically he was fully healed, but mentally he never wanted to leave. 
                    This taught me how much ‘medically cleared’ might not show the full picture. A person’s health is not just if their physical body works, but also how they feel about themselves and the environment they are surrounded by.

                <p>I learned more about the nursing side of patient care. While it can be routine, with taking vitals every 8 hours or giving daily medications, people also change drastically day-to-day. The minimal tasks that nurses do to keep patients comfortable are no less important than the orders that doctors put in. The whole team, with PT walking the patient down the hall, allows the patient to heal and nothing done is truly a one-person job.
